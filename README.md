# **Solo travel journal**

This site was a the last challenge from section 2 of Scrimba Learn React course.

This site was made without guidance, utilizing only the [figma archive](https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal).

You can see the final site on my [github-pages](https://samuellucas21504.github.io/scrimba-solo-travel-journal/) or via cloning and runing the app.

To run the code use: `npm start`
